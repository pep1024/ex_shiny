Comments:
Part 1
1) Indentation in main page
2) max line in answer
3) parameters in HTML. For instance, a("text", URL)
4) how to avoid space in p parameters
5) Use "" instead of `` ´´. Copy/Paste is possible

Part 2
1) image with no equal size (150 x 150)
2) The comment about fluidrow is confusing as it is not required for next exercise.
3) title = "Submitbutton" is confusing as title is not a parameter
4) Exercise for "checkbox" instead of checbox
5) name = ... seems to indicate that the parameter name is "name" when the parameter is "inputId"

Part 3
1) It is better to introduce fluidRow element now.
2) Sentence " ... close its parenthesis just before the submitbutton (excluding the two br)." is difficult to understand.
May be better right after the parentheses that closes the actionButton command.
3) Indicate that the help text must be inside the fluidRow command
4) Exercise 4, name it "number"
