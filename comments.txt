Comments:
Part 1
1) Indentation in main page
2) max line in answer
3) parameters in HTML. For instance, a("text", URL)
4) how to avoid space in p parameters
5) Use "" instead of `` ´´. Copy/Paste is possible

Part 2
1) image with no equal size (150 x 150)
2) The comment about fluidrow is confusing as it is not required for next exercise.
3) title = "Submitbutton" is confusing as title is not a parameter
4) Exercise for "checkbox" instead of checbox
5) name = ... seems to indicate that the parameter name is "name" when the parameter is "inputId"

Part 3
1) It is better to introduce fluidRow element now.
2) Sentence " ... close its parenthesis just before the submitbutton (excluding the two br)." is difficult to understand.
May be better right after the parentheses that closes the actionButton command.
3) Indicate that the help text must be inside the fluidRow command
4) Exercise 4, name it "number"

Part 4
1) Not clear where to include the second tabPanel
2) Better give a concrete file to upload

Part 5
1) deleteFile = FALSE (boolean not a string)
2) not clear why to use: normalizePath(file.path)

Part 6
1) sum is not a good name for a variable (it is also a function). Summary_iris could be used
2) Why as.data.frame.array is required? it is not explained
3) Annotate a plot is not related to Shiny. It is basically an option of plot function. It is confusing.
4) renderUI use is confusing. Which is the difference with using directly the widget?
5) It looks like the exercise finally does not work once you remove the submitButton.
6) A new verbatimTextOutput widget is introduced finally in Part 7

Part 7
1) exercise 1: textinput is in the ui.R not in server.R
2) To select the 4th variable as default names(iris)[4] is equivalent to names[[4]]
2) Insist that reactive variables are functions: They must be called with ()
